This is our project repositiory for the Edmonton Unlimited 2025 Hackathon.

We created an app for Edmonton Transit Se rvices to virtualize what can be done with the Arc card. Providing greater accessibility, limiting the needs of plastic cards, and user needs were kept in mind while developing this app.
